\section{Submission Note}


%\noindent 
Some preliminary results of this article appeared in {\it IEEE
International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 2016)
}\cite{zhao2016learning}. In this journal submission, we have made
significant changes over the conference version. We believe the
difference is more than 40\% over the conference version of this
work. The details of changes are summarized below:
\begin{enumerate}

\item First, we further design and evaluate another learning-based technique,
    support vector regression, in addition to the neural network methods.

\item (Please add more paragraphs showing additional works in detail. The
    following are examples shown from submissions from previous topics)

\item For solution quality study and analysis, we compared the both
  optimization algorithms on a number of examples. We found the result
  indicated that the previously proposed constrained optimization can
  lead to near-optimal results in general.

\item We showed the Pareto-like trade-off between the performance and
lifetime. We also discussed the trade-off as long-term and short-term
reliability effects.

\item We completely rewrote the abstract, introduction, problem
sections to reflect the new scope of the article.

\item The content of the article, including the notations and figures,
have been substantially revised to improve the presentation.


\end{enumerate}
